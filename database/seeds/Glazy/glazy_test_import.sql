Wood notes that the compositions of the cobalt ores used by ancient Chinese potters varied significantly through time and place. The ratio of the three primary colorants (cobalt, iron, and manganese) largely determine the character of the resulting blue. (Note that other oxides in the underglaze and glaze composition will also modify the color.)\r\n\r\nFor more information, see Nigel Wood\'s Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 12, Ceramic Technology, Part 6, Pigments, Enamels, and Gilding (pages 680-692). Nigel Wood writes extensively about the composition of Chinese blue & white underglaze pigments, with analyses of cobalt bearing absolites and other ores. Nigel Wood also covers the subject in Chinese Glazes (pages 61-66).\r\n\r\nNigel Wood\'s \"Chinese blue stoneware glaze\" is to be found in \"Chinese Glazes\" and on Glazy at http://glazy.org/recipes/2928\r\n\r\nThe test glaze is \"Simple Clear\" glaze to replace Leach 4321 as a standard test glaze. http://glazy.org/recipes/3465\r\nThis glaze is basically Digitalfire\'s G1947U (http://glazy.org/recipes/3306) without the Zinc.',41,NULL,NULL,0,7,7,'2015-11-20 19:14:17','2015-11-22 16:49:43'),

	(6065,NULL,NULL,'Green Gloss',NULL,NULL,NULL,'From Diana Pancioli\'s excellent publication, Glaze Forward:\r\nhttp://www.dianapancioli.com/\r\nhttp://www.dianapancioli.com/downloads/GlazeForward.pdf\r\n\r\nDerived from Cone 10 “Dimig Green”\r\nThis beautiful glossy green stays green unless the reduction is too heavy. Sometimes a pink blush will highlight one side of the piece. This glaze crazes. (Probably more flint will fix it). It is a stronger green with 5% copper but also leaches more.

Ball clay contains kaolinite, quartz, mica, titanium, iron, and small amounts of feldspars, bentonite, and illite. Ball clay also contains significant amounts of organic matter. Tennessee and Kentucky ball clays are secondary deposits of clay and volcanic ash materials from the middle Eocene (40 million years ago). The term ball clay came from the English practice of rolling the clay into large 50-pound balls for transport. In glazes ball clays provide alumina and silica and various impurities including iron and help to suspend the non-clay particles.

Montmorillonites also result from hydrothermal alteration of Mg/Fe-rich igneous rocks. Theoretical formula for montmorillonite is Al2Si4O10 (OH)2 nH2O where n is around 2-4. Mg replaces some of the Al, and Na and Ca ions hang around in the interlayer space, making for a very complex molecular structure. Bentonite consists of extremely small particles, most less than one micron. Bentonites are on the order of ten times finer than ball clays. There are two general classes of bentonites - the CaO-rich bentonites that do not swell much in water, and the CaO-poor, Na2O-rich bentonites that swell considerably.\r\n Bentonite is the most plastic material used in ceramics. Bentonites are used to add plasticity to clay bodies and help to suspend glaze ingredients.

Gerstley borate is a calcium borate ore containing the mineral Ulexite ( 3CaO Na2O 5B2O3 16H2O ), along with accessory minerals such as Bentonite, Colemanite, and Probertite. Gerstley borate was formed in marshes and drying lake basins during the Miocene (10 million years ago).\r\n Gerstley borate is named after James Gerstley, former managing director of Borax Consolidated Ltd. It is manufactured by U.S. Borax and Chemical Corp.; the mine is located near Death Valley, CA.\r\n G.B. is an inexpensive source of B2O3 and CaO in glazes. It is often used in place of colemanite. The primary differences are:\r\n1) colemanite contains a higher concentration of B2O3, \r\n2) G.B. contains Na2O, which may affect the color and surface of some glazes, and \r\n3) the Bentonite component of G.B. - up to 18% - significantly affects the properties of the raw glaze. (Some other sources indicate that this is not bentonite, but rather shale. GB glazes do tend to gel in either case.)\r\n\r\n Other points from IMC: \r\n1) GB is slightly soluble and tends to gel the glaze, necessitating excessive water and resulting in greater shrinkage of the raw glaze, which leads to crawling and other problems, especially when there is also a lot of clay in the glaze. Epsom salts (4g per 100g GB) can help. 2) The chemical and physical properties of the material (composition, mesh size, etc.) change over time. 3) GB can contain gypsum and lead to lime popping.\r\n Analyses:\r\n Axner: (web site, 2001)\r\n % 4.5 Na2O  0.25 K2O  3.5 MgO  22.0 CaO  1.0 Al2O3 29 B2O3  0.2 Fe2O3  10.0 SiO2  29.0 LOI\r\n Obstler: (Hammill & Gillespie)(also includes 6.2 LOD whatever that is)\r\n % 3.6-5.3 Na2O  2.9 MgO  17.1-20.6 CaO  1.3 Al2O3 25-28.9 B2O3  0.35 Fe2O3  10.6 SO2  30.5 LOI\r\n Hopper:\r\n 2 CaO  Na2O  3 B2O3  7 H2O\r\n Cushing:\r\n CaO  B2O3  5 H2O\r\n IMC:\r\n % 9.31 Na2O  16.85 CaO  52.25 B2O3  21.59 LOI\r\n ClayArt from Axner:\r\n This product is composed of a mixture of the minerals Colemanite and Ulexite.

First, there is the mineral Flint, an amorphous form of silica crystallized from water, and often containing calcium impurities. This is the predominant source of silica for potters in Europe. Second, there is the mineral Quartz, usually in the form of sandstone. Sandstone is an extremely widespread rock type in the U.S., so American potters usually obtain silica from this source. The largest supplier of silica to potters in the U.S. is the U.S. Silica Co., who obtains silica from Devonian sandstones (400 million years ago) in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. It is supplied in several mesh sizes under the trade name Sil-Co-Sil (or Supersil):\r\n Sil-Co-Sil #75   200 mesh\r\n #63   270 mesh\r\n #52   325 mesh\r\n #38   400 mesh\r\n The mesh size is very important, both in clays and in glazes.

It is a complex colloidal and extremely plastic magnesium aluminum silicate. It is an off-white insoluble flakey consistency and swells to many times its original volume when added to water. Its aqueous dispersions are thus high viscosity thixotropic gels at low solids; often a lot more water is needed to produced the desired viscosity. Veegum is not subject to attack by microorganisms. Various grades are classified according to viscosity and ratio of aluminum to magnesium content.\r\n\r\nIt is important to properly hydrate the powder, mix it in water before adding other ingredients (different grades of Veegum hydrate at different rates). The manufacturer emphasizes not underestimating the time needed, pointing out that in 25C water it could take 120 minutes using a propeller mixer! Using hot water or a higher energy mixer can drastically cut the time needed. If you are unable to mix the Veegum-containing slurry for the necessary time you can simply use more of the material (however keep in mind that this is a very expensive material). It is important to use the same water temperature, mixing time and energy and viscosity each time it is used to get consistent behavior in the slurry or pugged material.\r\n\r\nIn glazes VGT is used as an in-mix suspending agent and surface hardener. It is also suitable for use as a spray-on surface hardener before decorating (mix it with water and put a light layer on dried ware).\r\n\r\nIn bodies VGT is employed as a plasticizing agent. For example, in completely nonplastic formulations such as high alumina or zirconia bodies, VGT alone can produce sufficient working plastic. White burning porcelains are non-plastic by nature, but VGT is sufficient amounts (up to 5%) can produce a very plastic and workable material. It is a nonmigrating binder because it is not dissolved in the water. The material is clean and therefore does not affect fired whiteness.\r\n\r\nVGT has a high pH of 8.5 and yet acts as a flocculant, contributing to the workability of porcelain. 1.5-2.0% added to a porcelain, that is otherwise a little to short for modeling or throwing, will transform it into a plastic material.',35,0,1,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0.00,NULL,NULL,0,1,NULL,'2015-07-20 06:51:43','2015-09-25 15:31:28',NULL),

It is named after Montmorillon in France. Montmorillonite, a member of the smectite group, is a 2:1 clay, meaning that it has 2 tetrahedral sheets sandwiching a central octahedral sheet. The particles are plate-shaped with an average diameter around 1 μm. Members of this group include saponite.\r\n\r\nMontmorillonite is a subclass of smectite, a 2:1 phyllosilicate mineral being characterized as having greater than 50% octahedral charge; its cation exchange capacity is due to isomorphous substitution of Mg for Al in the gibbsitic plane. In contrast, beidellite is smectite with greater than 50% tetrahedral charge originating from isomorphous substitution of Al for Si in the quartz sheet.\r\n\r\nThe water content of montmorillonite is variable and it increases greatly in volume when it absorbs water. Chemically, it is hydrated sodium calcium aluminium magnesium silicate hydroxide (Na,Ca)0.33(Al,Mg)2(Si4O10)(OH)2·nH2O. Potassium, iron, and other cations are common substitutes, and the exact ratio of cations varies with source. It often occurs intermixed with chlorite, muscovite, illite, cookeite, and kaolinite.',13,0,1,1,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0.00,NULL,NULL,0,1,NULL,'2015-09-25 15:24:41','2015-09-25 15:24:41',NULL),
